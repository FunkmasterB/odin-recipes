        <p> Instructions</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sanitize all your equipment using One Step and water solution as per the instructions on the packet.
                Note: Never use bleach! Bleach will react negatively with the fermentation process.</li>
            <li>Put 4 cups of hot water in your 2-gallon fermenter, measure out about 2 ¾ lbs of honey and mix with the warm water in your bucket.</li>
            <li>Add 8 cups of cold water and stir</li>
            <li>Put must (honey and water mixture) in your hydrometer jar and float your hydrometer. Record your sugar level in brix on your chart. You should have 22.5 brix. This recipe will produce about 12.8% alcohol.</li>
            <li>Use the stick-on thermometer on your 2-gallon fermenter. You should have between 65 and 75 degrees.</li>
            <li>Add your yeast energizer and yeast nutrient stirring gently until dissolved.</li>
            <li>Pull out about 1 cup of your must in a two cup measure and pour your yeast pack in and stir gently. Let it sit for about 15 minutes or so. When it starts to foam, gently pour back into your fermenter bucket. Close your fermenter lid firmly, making sure it doesn't leak, and install your airlock.</li>
            <li>Your mead will start fermenting after a couple of hours. You will see your airlock start bubbling. Keep your fermenter in a place between 65 and 75 degrees and let the yeast do its work. This could take 10 to 20 days.</li>
            <li>When your air lock bubbling slows down dramatically, rack your mead into your 1-gallon jug using your siphoning tube. Be careful not to siphon up the sediment on the bottom of the fermenter.</li>
            <li>During racking, fill your hydrometer jar and measure your sugar level in brix with your hydrometer and record the reading on your chart. Return the mead in your hydrometer jar into your glass jug after you are done measuring the sugar level.</li>
            <li>When your fermentation is complete, you will see sediment settling in a distinct layer in your glass jug. (at this point your hydrometer should read a sugar level close to zero, if it doesn't, add more nutrient and energizer and continue fermentation)</li>
            <li>When this visible settling is down to the bottom of the jug, rack your mead into another jug. (if you don’t have another jug, use your cleaned fermenter bucket and then siphon the mead back into the glass jug after you have cleaned the jug.</li>
            <li>Once you have achieved your desired fermentation and racked your mead off the leas (sediment at the bottom) add ¾ tsp of Potassium Sorbate to your mead.</li>
            <li>Taste your mead. If you would like a little more sweetness, now is the time to add some of the honey you have left over from your starting 3 lbs. The sorbate will keep any further fermentation from happening.</li>
            <li>If you would like your mead to clarify a little faster you can add your bentonite as per the instructions on the packet. The down side to this is the bentonite creates a loose sediment layer and can waste more of your mead than just waiting for it to settle or using a filter like a Vinbrite Mark III.</li>
            <li>After your mead clarifies to your desired level it is ready to bottle. Crystal clarity is not necessary if you like the taste.
                Clean your bottles and bottling equipment. Bottle your mead. Your mead could improve if you want to put it away for a while. If you are thirsty, it’s ready to drink.</li>
